## Overview

The healthyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The __healthyverse__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the healthyverse in a single command.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("healthyverse")
# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/healthyverse")
```

## Usage

`library(healthyverse)` will load the core healthyverse packages: 

* [healthyR](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/), for analyzing common data problems in administrative data.
* [healthyR.data](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/), for a simulated data-set.
* [healthyR.ts](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/), for time-series functions.
* [healthyR.ai](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/), for ai related functions.
* [TidyDensity](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/), for tidy style r_ distribution data.
* [tidyAML](https://www.spsanderson.com/tidyAML/), for tidymodels auto-ml.
* [RandomWalker](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/), for random walk functions.


You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(healthyverse)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `healthyverse_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
healthyverse_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all tidyverse packages are up-to-date with `healthyverse_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
healthyverse_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * healthyR (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * healthyR.ts   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * healthyR.data  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
