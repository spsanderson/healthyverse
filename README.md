## Overview

The **healthyverse** is a comprehensive ecosystem of R packages
designed for healthcare data analysis, time-series forecasting, machine
learning, and statistical modeling. Inspired by the tidyverse
philosophy, the healthyverse packages work in harmony because they share
common data representations and API design patterns.

The **healthyverse** package itself is a meta-package that makes it
easy to install and load all core healthyverse packages in a single
command, similar to how the tidyverse package works for data science
workflows.

### Why healthyverse?

- **üè• Healthcare Focus**: Purpose-built tools for analyzing
  administrative healthcare data, patient records, and medical
  time-series
- **üîÑ Consistent API**: All packages follow similar design patterns,
  making them easy to learn and use together
- **üìä Comprehensive Toolkit**: From data cleaning to machine learning,
  all tools you need in one ecosystem
- **‚ö° Workflow Efficiency**: Load all packages at once and get notified
  of any function conflicts
- **üîç Dependency Management**: Built-in tools to check package versions
  and update the entire suite

## Installation

You can install the released version of healthyverse from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("healthyverse")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spsanderson/healthyverse")
```

## Core Packages

Loading `library(healthyverse)` will install and attach the following
core packages:

### Data Analysis & Management

- **[healthyR](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/)** - Tools for
  analyzing common data problems in healthcare administrative data.
  Includes functions for calculating length of stay, readmission rates,
  and other healthcare-specific metrics.

- **[healthyR.data](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/)** -
  Provides simulated healthcare datasets for testing and learning.
  Perfect for educational purposes and developing proof-of-concept
  analyses.

### Time-Series & Forecasting

- **[healthyR.ts](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/)** -
  Comprehensive time-series analysis and forecasting functions optimized
  for healthcare data patterns. Includes tools for seasonal
  decomposition, trend analysis, and automated forecasting.

### Machine Learning & AI

- **[healthyR.ai](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/)** - AI and
  machine learning utilities specifically designed for healthcare
  applications. Features automated model building, evaluation, and
  prediction workflows.

- **[tidyAML](https://www.spsanderson.com/tidyAML/)** - Automated
  machine learning (AutoML) framework built on tidymodels. Streamlines
  the process of training, tuning, and comparing multiple models
  simultaneously.

### Statistical Distributions & Simulation

- **[TidyDensity](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/)** - Generate
  and visualize probability distributions in a tidy format. Makes it
  easy to work with, compare, and plot various statistical
  distributions.

- **[RandomWalker](https://www.spsanderson.com/RandomWalker/)** -
  Simulate and analyze random walk processes. Useful for modeling
  stochastic processes and understanding random behavior in systems.

## Usage

### Getting Started

Simply load the healthyverse to get started:

``` r
library(healthyverse)
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ Attaching packages ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ healthyverse 1.0.4.9000 ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> ‚úî healthyR      0.2.2          ‚úî TidyDensity   1.5.0     
#> ‚úî healthyR.data 1.1.1          ‚úî tidyAML       0.0.5.9000
#> ‚úî healthyR.ts   0.3.0.9000     ‚úî RandomWalker  0.1.0     
#> ‚úî healthyR.ai   0.1.0
#> Warning: package 'healthyR.data' was built under R version 4.3.3
#> Warning: package 'TidyDensity' was built under R version 4.3.3
#> Warning: package 'parsnip' was built under R version 4.3.3
#> Warning: package 'RandomWalker' was built under R version 4.3.3
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflicts ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ healthyverse_conflicts() ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> ‚úñ tidyAML::check_duplicate_rows() masks TidyDensity::check_duplicate_rows()
#> ‚úñ tidyAML::quantile_normalize()   masks TidyDensity::quantile_normalize()
```

This single command loads all seven core packages and displays: - ‚úÖ
Which packages were loaded and their versions - ‚ö†Ô∏è Any conflicts with
functions from other loaded packages

### Managing Conflicts

You'll get an automatic summary of function conflicts when you load the
healthyverse. You can check for conflicts at any time:

``` r
library(MASS)
healthyverse_conflicts()
#> ‚îÄ‚îÄ Conflicts ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ healthyverse_conflicts() ‚îÄ‚îÄ
#> ‚úñ tidyAML::check_duplicate_rows() masks TidyDensity::check_duplicate_rows()
#> ‚úñ tidyAML::quantile_normalize()   masks TidyDensity::quantile_normalize()
```

### Keeping Packages Updated

Check if any healthyverse packages need updating:

``` r
healthyverse_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * healthyR (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * healthyR.ts   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * healthyR.data  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#> Update now?
#> 
#> 1: Yes
#> 2: No
```
